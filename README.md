# Loxone â†’ Node-RED â†’ Philips Hue Bridge  
### A reliable and local integration between Loxone and Philips Hue using Node-RED

---

## ðŸ”§ About this Project
Controlling **Philips Hue** lights directly from **Loxone** has always been tricky.  
This project bridges the two systems using **Node-RED** running on a **Raspberry Pi** or in **Docker** (got them both running),  
with a small **JavaScript mapping function** that normalizes events and payloads between Loxone and Hue.

Everything runs **locally** â€“ no external cloud or remote services required.

I tried everything to get it running without a service like Node-RED but did not get that working, the Pico-C code made my Loxone unstable (which is an achievement as such).So unfortunately with an extra component I got everything working pretty stable

So without further adue
